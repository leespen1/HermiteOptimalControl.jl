# Hermite Optimal Control
Julia package for evolving Schrodinger's equation with a control applied and
computing the gradient of the infidelity cost function. Will eventually be used
in quantum optimal control problem.

## To Do
- [ ] Fix 4th order discrete adjoint
- [ ] Implement arbitrarily high order evolution and gradient calculation using
      Hermite
- [ ] Implement larger systems:
    - [ ] 3-level qubit
    - [ ] Qubit and cavity
    - [ ] 2 qubits with cross talk
- [ ] Incorporate guard level population penalty
